# Hockey Biomechanics Analysis Dashboard - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Created

I've successfully created a comprehensive web application that consolidates all your hockey biomechanical analysis tools into one easy-to-use interface. This private dashboard allows you to upload MP4 videos and run various types of biomechanical analysis with just a few clicks.
